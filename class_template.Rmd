This is an example of some text. You can add *bold* text with the "*" and _italic_ using the "_".

You can also do lists:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

Or numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

We can add a hyperlink as [follows](http://www.alex-singleton.com).

Adding a block of R code is easy. When this document is knit, the default is to print the code and the output - for example:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Although, you can also add "echo=FALSE" to the "```{r echo=FALSE}" and the code will not print, but the outputs will still be shown:

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots using the same method, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
