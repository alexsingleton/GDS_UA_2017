# Group Project Assignment

The group project will be introduced at 13.15 on Day 3. The projects is designed so that you can implement those skills developed during the practical sessions within an applied context. The projects are to be conducted in groups, and the assesment will be a 15 minute presentation in the final session on Thursday 26th January. 

## Assignment 

For a city anywhere in the world; utilize those skills acquired during this course to create a data driven profile that describes:

1. Some aspects of population structure
2. An attribute that varies over both space and time
3. The spatial distribution of a social outcome

The project will run in two stages:

* _Stage 1_ - You will work within your groups to identify a city and associated data necessary to create a series of outputs that meet the three criteria above. You will then outline the type of outputs that you will create for your project. For each, you will need to create a flow chart of how you will implement you analysis.

* _Stage 2_ - A session has been allocated where you can discuss your proposed analysis with either Dani Arribas-Bel or Alex Singleton who will give feedback.

* _Stage 3_ - Two sessions have been allocated that will enable you to complete your analysis and create a presentation.

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the quality of your city profiles and in particular the supporting visual materials that you create. Extra marks will be given for presentations where the choice of analysis techniques are justified.

## Prizes

Extra special prizes will be awarded during the final session!
